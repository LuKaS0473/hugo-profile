Welcome to www.lukasweissenhorn.com. We try our best to make sure that discussions about our articles are free of trolls, spam, and abuse, but we are not omnipresent. The comments section can be a great place to interact with readers and authors, and even spark stimulating conversation - it can be a great place for all of us! To ensure that you feel comfortable here, please adhere to the following guidelines:

    Be polite - don't be rude to others and respect others. If you say something that you would get a beating for offline, please don't say it here. Remember that there is a human being behind the screen and that your words affect other people.
    Don't troll. We appreciate and welcome criticism of authors, but comments that don't contribute to the discussion or are simply offensive will be deleted without exception.
    Spam? Goodbye. We understand that you may make thousands of dollars working from home, but we are not interested. Please refrain from posting or we will reach out and kick you and your post out the door.

To put it in one simple sentence, our guidelines are "Don't be an asshole". If you do not follow these guidelines, our moderators will not only remove the comment, but we may also ban you from participating in the discussions.

If you find comments that violate our guidelines, please make sure to 'flag' or 'mark as spam' them - our moderators greatly appreciate your assistance!

Have fun commenting!
